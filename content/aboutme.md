After graduated from high school, I chose Applied Chemistry as my major in South China Agricultural University by accident. However, when I actually had the chance to get to know chemistry at university, I realized it was not what I want at all. What really sparks my interest are the logic of mathematics and practicality of engineering. In this regard, Civil engineering is a perfect combination of both, and I want to pursue it as my whole life career. Therefore, after considering about it thoroughly, I decided to jump into civil engineering without any hesitation. This is how I started my stressful yet thrilling life.

Self-studying was a stressful work since I already had loads of work to do with my major. But I am just not the type who will give up easily, and  sometimes interest is indeed a huge encouragement for me especially when there is a comparison between civil engineering and chemistry. I’m glad that I did it — I finished most of the core courses by myself (including: Statics, Kinematics and Dynamics, Mechanics of Materials, Structural Mechanics, Reinforced Concrete, Structure Seismic Design and so on). Meanwhile, I didn’t give up on my major and I got an average grade of 91.26/100 for my undergraduate studies, ranking 2 out of 121 students. I am specifically excellent at Mathematics (shown in detail in my C.V.).

When applying for the master degree, there is a person I really want to thank – my current supervisor Prof.Yuen. He is the very person who gives me the chance to pursue my graduate study in civil engineering and offers me a lot of instruction and advice. That’s why I’m here today as a master student in Department of Civil Engineering, University of Macau. Under the instruction of Prof.Yuen, my current research focuses on updating the Finite Element Model (FEM) with incomplete modal data. In this method, the updated FEM can reproduce the measured modal frequency exactly, and the unmeasured modal data stays the same. I am writing a journal article about this new method right now and plan to submit it to Engineering Structures very soon.

Besides academic work on Civil Engineering, I also love painting and photography. I believe there is never a limit between science and art. All these interests are my eternal sunshine, and I’m sure, with enthusiasm and persistence, each of my prayer will be accepted, and each wish will be resigned!
