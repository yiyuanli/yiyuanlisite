title: CV sample in LaTeX
---
Here is my own C.V. code in LaTeX. In fact, it is modified based on the 
version of [Jason Blevins](https://jblevins.org/projects/cv-template/)‘ 
sample.  I have made a lot of changes and improvements to fit into 
my requirements.
One of the most important advantages for internet is to share, 
thus we can improve ourselves by learning from others. Your 
suggestions for this C.V. sample is greatly welcomed.
 
我用LaTeX写的C.V.，是在Jason Blevins的sample基础上改进的，还是很多地方被我改过了的。
