Every now and then I search for some questions, there are always some 
awesome blogs which provide me with some great answers. Moreover, 
the blog owners are some brilliant people form different areas.

my mind.

    I found this website when I searched for a problem about 3-D frame
	structure. It impressed me a lot that I realized being a researcher
	can be such cool. And it was the first time I decided to start 
	my personal website,too: just to record my study progress and 
	share the knowledge with other people in Civil Engineering.

    Prof. Guo works on Cognitive Science. There are a lot of useful 
	tips involving: how to write an Email, how to be a good Ph.D 
	student, even how to get an English name, etc. Besides I really 
	admire his attitude towards science.
