title: Linearity and Nonlinearity
---

**Linear function** (refers to two notions):

1. In calculus: linear function refers to the polynomial function with no more than degree of one.
2. In algebra: linear function refers to a linear mapping: V → W with any two vectors x and y (belong to V) satisfying the following conditions:
    + *Superposition*: f (x+y) = f (x) + f (y)    
    + *Homogeneity*: f (αx)= αf(x)

f(x)=2x+3 is a linear function in calculus.
Is it called nonlinear function in algebra?

**Linear operator**:
When V=W, the linear mapping is called linear operator.

**Linear system** (From Wikipedia):
