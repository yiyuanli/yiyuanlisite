My current research focuses on: Direct model updating method using incomplete modal measurements based on system control theory. 

After applying this new method, the updated Finite Element (FE) model can reproduce the measured modal frequencies exactly without disturbing the unmeasured modal frequencies.

At first, a 960 degree-of-freedom (DOF) FE model was used to illustrate the efficiency of this method. The following figures are the first 10 mode shapes of the updated FE model. There are totally 7 translational modes and 3 torsional modes. 6 translational modes are along X axis, i.e. 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th modes, and 1 translational mode are along Y axis, i.e. 3rd mode. The 3 torsional modes are 4th, 8th and 10th modes.

Later, Prof. Yuen suggested me to improve the structure as large as possible, like 5000 DOFs, so I modified this example to a 7200-DOF frame structure. The updated mode shapes are as follows. There are totally 7 translational modes, 2 torsional modes and 1 coupled mode. 5 translational modes are along X axis, i.e. 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, modes, and 2 translational mode are along Y axis, i.e. 2nd and 8th mode. The 2 torsional modes are 3rd and 8th modes. The 9th mode is torsional and translational coupled mode.
